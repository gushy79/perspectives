# Perspectives Content Backlog

**Goal:** 12-20 topic ideas for sustainable 1/month publishing cadence
**Current Count:** 6 topics defined (need 6-14 more)
**Review Cadence:** Monthly/weekly to adjust priorities and stay current with architecture trends
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-08

## Active Priorities (Series 1 - Next 3 Pieces)

These are the immediate focus for initial launch.

### 1. "Just Enough Architecture" ⭐ HIGH PRIORITY
**Category:** Philosophy (Pragmatic Governance)
**Target Audience:** CTOs, EAs, Architecture practitioners frustrated with heavyweight governance
**Purpose:** Core philosophy piece - demonstrates pragmatic approach that accelerates delivery
**Key Message:** Architecture governance doesn't have to slow teams down
**Concrete Example:** How "Just Enough Architecture" at Oxa enabled rapid delivery while maintaining quality
**Estimated Difficulty:** Medium (well-understood, but needs fresh angle)
**Strategic Value:** Differentiator - shows mature judgment on when/how much architecture to apply
**Status:** Not started

---

### 2. "Building Architecture Functions from Scratch" ⭐⭐ HIGHEST PRIORITY
**Category:** Organizational Capability
**Target Audience:** Heads of Architecture, CTOs hiring for EA roles, growing startups
**Purpose:** Strongest differentiator - Oxa achievement (Series-C AI startup, built from zero)
**Key Message:** Practical blueprint for establishing architecture capability in organizations without it
**Concrete Example:** How I built architecture function at Oxa from scratch (Design Authority, ADRs, standards)
**Estimated Difficulty:** Medium-High (balancing specificity with generalization)
**Strategic Value:** UNIQUE - Most architects inherit functions; Nick built one from scratch
**Note:** Consider leading with this piece for maximum impact
**Status:** Not started

---

### 3. "Architecture as a Product" ⭐ HIGH PRIORITY
**Category:** Modern Strategic Thinking
**Target Audience:** EAs, Product-minded architects, Engineering leadership
**Purpose:** Modern positioning - stakeholder-centric architecture delivery
**Key Message:** Architecture should serve stakeholders like a product, not dictate from ivory tower
**Concrete Example:** Design Authority operating model at Oxa (architecture as service, not gate)
**Estimated Difficulty:** Medium (concept well-known, but needs Nick's practical spin)
**Strategic Value:** Shows modern thinking and product mindset
**Status:** Not started

---

## Series 2 (Initial Backlog - Next 3 Pieces)

These are candidate topics for after Series 1 is published.

### 4. "Age of Intent" - AI/LLM Effects on System Interaction
**Category:** Emerging Trends (AI Impact)
**Target Audience:** EAs, CTOs, Forward-thinking architects
**Purpose:** Thought leadership on AI-driven UX transformation
**Key Message:** AI shifts user interaction from explicit commands to intent expression
**Concrete Example:** How systems need to evolve data models and APIs for AI-mediated user journeys
**Estimated Difficulty:** High (requires balancing vision with pragmatism)
**Strategic Value:** Demonstrates forward-thinking and AI awareness
**Status:** Not started

---

### 5. "AI as the Consumer" - Designing for AI Era
**Category:** Emerging Trends (AI Architecture)
**Target Audience:** EAs, Solution Architects, API designers
**Purpose:** Practical guidance on designing systems for AI consumption
**Key Message:** When AI consumes your APIs, architecture assumptions change (latency, error handling, etc.)
**Concrete Example:** TBD (need specific example from experience or case study)
**Estimated Difficulty:** High (needs concrete grounding)
**Strategic Value:** Positions Nick as AI-aware architect
**Note:** May need to wait for more hands-on AI integration experience
**Status:** Not started

---

### 6. "Legacy Modernisation Patterns"
**Category:** Practical Patterns (Technical Depth)
**Target Audience:** Principal Architects, Solution Architects, IC roles
**Purpose:** Technical depth piece - demonstrates hands-on modernisation experience
**Key Message:** Proven patterns for modernising legacy systems without "big bang" rewrites
**Concrete Example:** Specsavers modernisation (8M users, 11 countries) or Westcoast integration work
**Estimated Difficulty:** Medium (well-understood domain for Nick)
**Strategic Value:** Appeals to Principal/IC roles needing technical depth
**Status:** Not started

---

## Future Topics (To Be Developed)

**Target:** Add 6-14 more topics to reach 12-20 total

**Content Mix Guidelines:**
- **Philosophy pieces** (like #1): 20-30% of backlog
- **Practical patterns** (like #6): 30-40% of backlog
- **Organizational capability** (like #2): 20-30% of backlog
- **Emerging trends** (like #4, #5): 10-20% of backlog

**Sources for Topics:**
- Recent LinkedIn discussions in architecture community
- Hot topics at architecture conferences (e.g., GOTO, QCon, NDC)
- Recurring interview questions
- Common challenges mentioned by recruiters
- Personal experience highlights from CV not yet covered

**Topic Development Process:**
1. Identify gap or trend in architecture discourse
2. Check: Do I have concrete experience to draw from?
3. Validate with architecture-peer agent (technical soundness)
4. Validate with personal-marketeer agent (strategic value)
5. Add to backlog with priority

---

## Backlog Maintenance

**Review Triggers:**
- **Weekly:** Scan architecture news/LinkedIn for hot topics
- **Monthly:** Formal backlog review with agents
- **After publishing:** Reassess priorities based on response/feedback

**Add Topics When:**
- New architecture trend emerges (e.g., AI, platform engineering)
- Interview question reveals gap in current positioning
- LinkedIn discussion shows high engagement on specific topic
- Recruiter mentions specific capability employers seek

**Remove Topics When:**
- Topic becomes stale or too mainstream
- Lack of concrete examples from personal experience
- Strategic value diminishes (doesn't support target roles)

**Reorder Priorities When:**
- Hot topic emerges that needs timely response
- Job search focus shifts (IC vs Leadership vs Hybrid)
- New achievement provides better example than planned topic

---

## Topic Template (For New Additions)

```markdown
### [Topic Number]. "[Topic Title]"
**Category:** [Philosophy / Practical Patterns / Organizational Capability / Emerging Trends]
**Target Audience:** [Who benefits most from this?]
**Purpose:** [Why write this piece?]
**Key Message:** [One-sentence core insight]
**Concrete Example:** [What real experience will you draw from?]
**Estimated Difficulty:** [Low / Medium / High]
**Strategic Value:** [How does this support career goals?]
**Status:** [Not started / Outline / Draft / Review / Published]
```

---

## Success Metrics

**For the backlog:**
- ✅ Always have 3-5 "ready to write" topics (outline-ready, examples identified)
- ✅ Never face "blank page" writer's block
- ✅ Can respond quickly to hot topics when they emerge
- ✅ Topics span all content categories (philosophy, patterns, capability, trends)
- ✅ Clear connection between each topic and career positioning goals

**For individual topics:**
- ✅ Concrete example from real experience identified
- ✅ Technical credibility validated by architecture-peer agent
- ✅ Strategic value validated by personal-marketeer agent
- ✅ Clear target audience defined
- ✅ One-sentence key message crafted

---

## Notes

**LinkedIn Habit Building:**
The content backlog directly supports building a consistent LinkedIn posting habit. Each published perspective can be converted into 2-3 posts, providing systematic visibility without starting from scratch each time.

**Interview Prep Integration:**
Each topic becomes a structured answer to common interview questions. The backlog should include topics that address likely questions for target roles (EA, Principal SA, Head of Architecture).

**Portfolio Website Integration:**
As backlog grows and pieces are published, the Portfolio website Perspectives section becomes a living body of work demonstrating sustained thought leadership over time.
